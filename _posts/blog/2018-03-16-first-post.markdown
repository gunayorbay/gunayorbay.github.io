Hello everyone! This is my most recent attempt to perpare an easy-to-manage web space for myself. 

<!--more-->

After fruitless attempts with `Wordpress`, intermittent `mysql` problems, `AWS EC2` setup difficulties, I am giving `jekyll` a try. It seems very straigtforward and easy IF you can manage to upgrade `ruby` to an acceptable version. My experience hasn't been as smooth as advertised on a Macbook.

Welp! Till next time. - G
