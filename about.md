I am an enthusiast of anything music, computer graphics, and arts. I hold mechanical engineering degrees from [METU](http://www.metu.edu) (BSc, MSc) and [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu) (PhD) though my interests go beyond. I have previously worked at [ANSYS Inc.](https://www.ansys.com) as part of the [Discovery Live](https://www.ansys.com/products/3d-design/ansys-discovery-live) team.
