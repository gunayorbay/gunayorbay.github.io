After randomly learning about Hugo, the static webpage creator, I immediately wanted to give it a try as it resembled Jekyll quite a bit. To my surprise, I find Hugo to be much much easier to install in contrast to wrestling with ruby and gems. The difference is quite stark in the time that I spent to get the first page up and running.

The list of positives for me is quite short for now but I'm sure I'll have more than enough opinions about Hugo the more I use it.

For now, I say Jekyll farewell and give Hugo a warm welcome.
