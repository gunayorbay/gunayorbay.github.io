I am an enthusiast of anything music, computer graphics, and arts. I hold mechanical engineering degrees from [METU](http://www.metu.edu) (BSc, MSc) and [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu) (PhD) though my interests go beyond. I currently work at [ANSYS Inc.](https://www.ansys.com) as part of the [Discovery Live](https://www.ansys.com/products/3d-design/ansys-discovery-live) team. You can reach me through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunayorbay/) for professional inquiries.

I intend to keep this space up to date with my career endeavors and personal projects. It will hopefully serve to make it worth your time on here.
