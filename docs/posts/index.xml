      <description>After randomly learning about Hugo, the static webpage creator, I immediately wanted to give it a try as it resembled Jekyll quite a bit. To my surprise, I find Hugo to be much much easier to install in contrast to wrestling with ruby and gems. The difference is quite stark in the time that I spent to get the first page up and running.
The list of positives for me is quite short for now but I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll have more than enough opinions about Hugo the more I use it.</description>

      <description>I am finally bringing back the list of publications, including abstracts, copy-paste bibtex citations, and more.
I intend to add more content besides just published work.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! This is my most recent attempt to perpare an easy-to-manage web space for myself.
After fruitless attempts with Wordpress, intermittent mysql problems, AWS EC2 setup difficulties, I am giving jekyll a try. It seems very straigtforward and easy IF you can manage to upgrade ruby to an acceptable version. My experience hasn&amp;rsquo;t been as smooth as advertised on a Macbook.
Welp! Till next time. - G</description>
